<h1>Chapter I</h1>
<p>An Unexpected Party</p>
<h2>But the dwarves only started to sing:</h2>
<p> <i>Chip the glasses and crack the plates! <br>
    Blunt the knives and bend the forks! <br>
    That's what Bilbo Baggins hates<br>
    Smash the bottles and burn the corks! <br> <br>
    Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! <br>
    Pour the milk on the pantry floor! <br>
    Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! <br>
    Splash the wine on every door! <br> <br>
    Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; <br>
    Pound them up with a thumping pole; <br>
    And when you've finished, if any are whole, <br>
    Send them down the hall to roll ! <br> <br>
    That's what Bilbo Baggins hates! <br>
    So, carefully! carefully with the plates!</i></p>
